# Post-COVID Knowledge Graph (KG) 🦠🔍📊

Welcome to the Post-COVID Knowledge Graph (KG) repository! 🌟

## About ℹ️
The Post-COVID Knowledge Graph project aims to comprehensively map the molecular mechanisms, gene-disease associations, drug-target interactions, and omics data from patients, providing insights into post-COVID-19 syndrome and potential treatment options. Utilizing resources like the COVID-19 Disease Map,pyBiodataFuse python package and different drug repurposing algorithms, this project seeks to integrate information from various sources to achieve a thorough understanding of the disease and its potential treatments.

## Projects 🛠️

This repository hosts several parts related to the Post-COVID Knowledge Graph. Each part addresses different aspects of post-COVID-19 syndrome; KG construction, data exploration and visualization, and algorithm implementation. 📑📊💻

### Project 1: Knowledge Graph Construction 🧩
Description: In this project, we build the Post-COVID Knowledge Graph using transcriptomic data and the pyBiodataFuse python package to extract relevant associations between genes, drugs, diseases, gene ontologies, locations and pathways. 🧠🖥️

### Project 2: Data Exploration and Visualization 📊👀
Description: Gene set enrichment analysis, over-representation analysis, PPI networks in Cytoscape.

### Project 3: Drug Repurposing Algorithm 💊🔄
Description: This part involves selecting different algorithms, visualising them, and comparing their functionality and results.
