# Post-COVID Knowledge Graph (KG) 🦠🔍📊

## Drug Repurposing Algorithm: Link prediction using Al-Saleem algorithm's variation 💊🔄
This part involves running the Al-Saleem algorithm variation in the previously generated post-COVID-19 KG.

### Schema
![unnamed](https://github.com/macsbio/post-covid-kg/assets/113828670/ee647d21-b664-4a44-968c-b3b4511c0459)


### Algorithm implementation
In this case, we directly query the graph from neo4j so there's no need to have any input archive if you have the KG implemented in neo4j.  

Scripts:
- algorithm2.py

Output files:
- results2.csv
